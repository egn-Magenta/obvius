# backup_postgres - makes a backup of PostgreSQL databases.
#                   Which databases to backup on which server is controlled
#                   by the presence of the files: 
#                     POSTGRES:"dbname" 
#                     POSTGRES_SERVER_"hostname"
#                   Files are placed in backup/ under the current site. All filenames
#                   are prefixed with "PG_" to distinguish them from MySQL databases.
#
#                   Notice: This script just dumps databases to disk. Another script is
#                   needed to copy them somewhere else. The ordinary Obvius backup script
#                   could be such a script.
