The following changes have been added to htmlarea to make it
work with Obvius:



htmlarea.js file:

- Removed onunload handler since it seemed to mess up saving
of the data when having more than one editor.

- Added a config option, resizeToolbars, to make the toolbars
be resized to the same size as the editor/textarea.

- Re-enabled the warning about MSIE-fullscreen mode not
working properly.


obvius_htmlarea.js file:

This file contains functions used to override the default
htmlarea functions:

- htmlarea_InsertImage_Obvius
    Used to override HTMLArea._insertImage. Makes sure
    baseURL is always passed to the image dialog and
    starts the Obvius image dialog instead of the standard
    htmlarea image dialog.

- htmlarea_CreateLink_Obvius
    Used to override HTMLArea._createLink. Makes sure
    baseURL is always passed to the link dialog and
    starts the Obvius link dialog instead of the standard
    htmlarea link dialog.

- htmlarea_stripBaseURL_Obvius
    Used to override HTMLArea.stripBaseURL
    Only converts MSIE "http:///" links to "/" instead of
    stripping down urls to the baseURL. We do this since
    Obvius wants URLs starting with a "/".


htmlarea.css file:

- Added a 1px solid black border to all htmlarea iframes.
