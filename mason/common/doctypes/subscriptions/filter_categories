This component is used by the subscription-system to filter unwanted
categories from the list.

Usually this would entail keeping "top level" categories only, as
matching is done with right-truncation, when checking whether a
document is legible for sending.

Having this component means that each website only has to have a local
one of these to filter; less copying of code. Hopefully.
